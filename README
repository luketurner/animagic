# What Is animagic?

First and foremost, animagic is a programming project for yours truly.  Hopefully it will eventually become useful to the general public, however, no promises are made on that account.

# Okay, but what will it maybe do?

Well, animagic is basically going to be a system that automatically downloads new episodes of your favorite running anime. At first it will probably use a user-set "keyword-search" mechanism to detect new episodes of the anime in question.

By the way, I mean download through bittorrent. Probably animagic will only download the relevant torrent files, leaving your torrent client to do the rest (most modern clients have functionality to watch a folder for new torrents).
